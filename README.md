# GoMarSok

## Realtime Markdown Preview Server

GoMarSok gives you live viewing of markdown â†’ HTML as you ~~type~~ send to the socket.

Specifically designed for Emacs. The markdown service is powered by
Golang, using the Gorilla Websockets library, and
[Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/enterprise/11.10.340/user/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

On the Emacs side, you have gomarsok.el.
