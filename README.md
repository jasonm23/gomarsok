# GoMarSok

## Realtime Markdown Preview Server

GoMarSok gives you live viewing of markdown â†’ HTML as you ~~type~~ send to the socket.

#### You need GoMarSok if...

- [x] The delay to save a markdown document and preview is just way
    too long.
- [x] You want to view your preview in multiple screens/devices at the
    same time, phone, tablet, desktop, projector? (via your local
    network or perhaps the internet)
- [x] You use Emacs to write your markdown, and want to stay there.
