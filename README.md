#### Realtime Markdown Preview via WebSockets / Golang

#### You need GoMarSok if...

- [x] The delay to save a markdown document and preview is just way
    too long.
- [x] You want to view your preview in multiple screens/devices at the
    same time, phone, tablet, desktop, projector? (via your local
    network or perhaps the internet)
- [x] You want to use Emacs (or another websockets enabled editor) to
    write your markdown.
